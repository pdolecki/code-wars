/*
You already implemented a Cube class, but now we need your help again! I'm talking about constructors. We don't have one. Let's code two: One taking an integer and one handling no given arguments!

Also we got a problem with negative values. Correct the code so negative values will be switched to positive ones!

The constructor taking no arguments should assign 0 to Cube's Side property.
*/
export class Cube {
  private _side: number;

  constructor(private side: number = 0) {
    this._side = Math.abs(side);
  }

  public getSide(): number {
    return this._side;
  }

  public setSide(value: number) {
    this._side = Math.abs(value);
  }
}
